Check the website out to understand what characters are there and what character I omitted from the very short description above.

## The database

The database is a very simple one using mariaDB, it creates 2 tables, the user and the messages/comments table connecting it via the userID.

1 user can have multiple comments and a comment can have only 1 user (one to many relationship)

## Other functionality

### Comments
As metioned before you can add comments to the characters that you find on the page, be it talking about how much you love them or how much you despise that character.

Comments are not moderated cause as if I'm doing that, so be kind.

### Account creation
You can create an account on the website using a fake email and a fake password (isn't validated for the sakes of the demo and keeping your data safe), accounts are permanent, going against GDPR, I will NOT delete your accounts EVER!

#### Requesting data
Too bad. You can't, get the GDPR on me, see if I care.
